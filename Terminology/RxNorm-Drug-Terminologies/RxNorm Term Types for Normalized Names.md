# RxNorm Term Types for Normalized Names

## Summary
RXNORM source uses term types (TTYs) to indicate generic and branded drug names at different levels of specificity. This dataset includes the full list of term types, where source provider is RXNORM.

## Description
RxNorm provides normalized names for clinical drugs and links its names to many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction software, including those of First Databank, Micromedex, MediSpan, Gold Standard Drug Database, and Multum. By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary.

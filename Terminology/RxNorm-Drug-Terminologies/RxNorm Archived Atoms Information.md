# RxNorm Archived Atoms Information 

## Summary
This dataset includes history information about RxNorm atoms. It contains information about SAB=RXNORM atoms that are no longer in “RxNorm Drugs Names and Identifiers”.

## Description
RxNorm provides normalized names for clinical drugs and links its names to many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction software, including those of First Databank, Micromedex, MediSpan, Gold Standard Drug Database, and Multum. By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary.

The dataset contains data about RxNorm Source provider (atoms) that are no longer a part of the RxNorm database because the drug data source provider is no longer providing this name to RxNorm.

# RxNorm Source Provider Information

## Summary
This data set contains contact information for source providers, available term types and attributes, and other information related to each RxNorm source.

## Description
RxNorm provides normalized names for clinical drugs and links its names to many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction software, including those of First Databank, Micromedex, MediSpan, Gold Standard Drug Database, and Multum. By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary.

RxNorm receives drug names from 14 source terminologies. In addition to the 14 data sources, the derived RxNorm normalized drug names become a terminology. 
RxNorm reflects and preserves the meanings, drug names, attributes, and relationships from its sources. There is one row in this file for every source in RxNorm.
